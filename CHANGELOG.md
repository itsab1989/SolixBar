# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.3.6 - 2026-07-10

- Restored high-contrast bright text in the detached slim bar with a darker glass surface and text shadow.
- Hid `Gesamt`/total yield automatically when the SOLIX data source cannot provide a real cumulative total.

## 0.3.5 - 2026-07-09

- Corrected total-yield handling so a newly entered Anker app cumulative value resets the local runtime counter instead of leaving `Gesamt` at today's value.
- Ignored zero-valued API totals when choosing a total-yield source and added an extra SOLIX statistics lookup.
- `Gesamt` now stays empty instead of showing the local daily/runtime counter when neither the API nor the configured Anker app start value provides a true cumulative total.

- Rounded the app icon shown in the menu bar and detached slim bar.
